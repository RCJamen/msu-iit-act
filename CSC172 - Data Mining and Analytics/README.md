# CSC172: Data Mining
Course Instructor: Orven Llantos, PhD
## Course Overview

Data Mining is a branch of computer science that studies algorithms and computational paradigms to help computers:
- Identify patterns and regularities in databases.
- Perform prediction and forecasting.
- Improve performance through data interaction.

Data Mining plays a crucial role in a broader process called **Knowledge Discovery**, which aims to extract meaningful knowledge from raw data. The **Knowledge Discovery** process involves:
1. Data selection
2. Data cleaning
3. Data coding
4. Application of statistical and machine learning techniques
5. Visualization of generated patterns

This course will cover the entire Knowledge Discovery process, providing real-world examples of each step. Special attention will be given to **Machine Learning methods**, as they are the primary tools for knowledge discovery.
